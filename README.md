# Comparative Analysis 

In the comparison of execution times between the C and assembly kernels, the assembly version demonstrates a significant performance improvement due to its ability to leverage low-level optimizations, such as register usage and reduced overhead from high-level language abstractions. The C kernel, while more portable and easier to understand, incurs additional overhead, leading to slower execution times. This showcases how assembly can outperform C in performance-critical tasks, especially in computationally intensive operations like the dot product.
