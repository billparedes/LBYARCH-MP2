# Comparative Analysis 
In comparing the execution time of C and Assembly kernels, Assembly shows a significant performance since it is faster than C. Although C kernel is easier to understand, it still incurs additional overhead and leads to slower execution times. This showcases how the Assembly language can outperform C in performance-critical tasks, especially in computationally intensive operations like the dot product.
